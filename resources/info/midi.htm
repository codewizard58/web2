    <h1>Midi Kit</h1>
    <p>The Midi kit has many modules.</p>
    <p>Midi is has a lot of functionality. Multiple Midi interfaces can be used at the same time. The 
        <span style='color: red;'>(Action )</span> Midi Group (in / Out) modules create and modify Midi Interface / Midi Channel groups. 
        The input and output modules such as Midi CV (note) in and out are assigned to a group (Default initially).
        You use the Midi Group modules to create as many groups as you need. Some modules such as the (Action ) player 
        module will add interfaces and groups as needed.
    </p>
    <p>Most of the Midi wiring is not visible. The main Midi modules that have snaps are the Midi note (CV) and 
        Control Change (CC) ones. The Midi input modules act like (Basic ) Power On and have an output that is 
        determined by the note or control change value. The Midi output modules for notes (CV) and Control change 
        (CC) have a pass through output which allows them to be chained. 
    </p>
    <p>Note Groups allow the tracking of note on and off data. Typically a notegroup will track a set number of notes.
        The default is 3. When a note is started, a free slot in the notegroup is assigned and when that note stops 
        playing that slot is marked as free. When a second note starts playing, it will be assigned the next free slot. 
        Various slot assignment methods are supported. When the note is passed on, the Midi channel is set to the
        slot number. This allows several Midi note inputs to each be assigned their own notegroup slot so they can
        each then be connected to a monophonic sound generator such as the (Sound kit) Oscillator or a Midi note output 
        module.
    </p>
    <p>The <span style='color: red;'>(Action )</span> Target module allows most knobs to be mapped to a Midi control change message. You select the 
        Target module and click Add. You then move the know you want to map. The knob will be added to the target list
        and then you adjust the Midi control and the knob will now be mapped to the control. The Target module allows 
        many knobs to be mapped. You can clear mappings and also delete them.
    </p>
    <p>There is always the Local interface that connects data sent to an output (note or control ) back to an input. The 
        Net interface sends data to the web server.</p>
