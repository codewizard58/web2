    <h1>Sound Kit</h1>
    <p>The Sound kit has many modules.</p>
    <p>The Audio signal paths have yellow snaps with a rectangular shape. You cannot dock a regular snap
        with an audio snap. The Littlebits Korg Synth kit Oscillator turns off when the input gets close to 0 volts.
        In the sound modules an input value of less than 20 will cause the module to mute. This functionality is used 
        by many modules such as the (Basic kit) sequencer output which has the selected "knob" value during the gate period and 
        then goes to 0.
