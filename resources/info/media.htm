    <h1>Media Kit</h1>
    <p>The Media kit has many modules.</p>
    <p>The Media kit provides Virtual Reality support. The <span style='color:red; '>Action / Headset</span> module has various controls
        for the Virtual World. Selecting the Media kit also displays buttons that allow the
        user to enter Immersive mode when the headset allows it and to use inline VR mode with 
        the "Play" tab on the Web interface.
    </p>
    <p>The surprising thing about the VR world is the lack of precision in pointing. With a mouse you can be pixel perfect. With a touch
        interface the resolution goes down and you lose things like hover. When you move to VR controllers, the shake when activating the buttons
        makes it even less precise. For inline modes I have added keyboard shortcuts that work in both 2D and 3D. The keyboard shortcuts are 
        mostly position independent, you just need the canvas selected.
